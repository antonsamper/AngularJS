# AngularJS - useragent

A simple AngularJS module that adds the current useragent and platform as attributes on the `html` tag. Additionally, it runs a simple test to detect 'touch' support and outputs the result as a class also on the `html` tag. This module is based off [Rogie King's](http://rog.ie/) [HTML5 Boilerplate Add-on - CSS: User Agent Selectors](http://rog.ie/blog/html5-boilerplate-addon).
